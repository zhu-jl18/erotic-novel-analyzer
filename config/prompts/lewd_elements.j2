You are extracting lewd elements (non-deal-breaker tags) from an adult novel.

## Inputs
Allowed character names (MUST use exactly; do NOT invent new names):
{{ allowed_names_json }}

## Output Types (ONLY these)
- 乱伦
- 调教
- 恋足
- 萝莉

## Rules
- You MUST call the function tool "{{ tool_name }}".
- Always return a non-empty lewd_elements_summary.
- Return ONLY the types that are present in the content.
- For each type, return at most ONE representative example.
- If no lewd elements are present, return an empty array and a short lewd_elements_summary.
- example MUST be non-empty; if unknown, use "未知" or "未提及".
- involved_characters (if provided) MUST be from allowed names.
- chapter_location (if unknown) can be empty string or "未知".

## Special rule: 萝莉 (strict)
- You MUST output type "萝莉" ONLY if the text provides clear underage / low-age evidence.
  Examples of clear evidence: explicit age < 18, "未成年", "小学生", "初中生".
- If the text only describes "幼态/娇小/萝莉风" without clear underage evidence, DO NOT output "萝莉".
